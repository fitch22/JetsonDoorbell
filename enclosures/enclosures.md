# Enclosures

In this folder you will find several example designs for enclosing your Jetson Doorbell and a speaker. Each file type has its original source in Solidworks format along with a STEP format and STL. You can print the STL file as is or modify the Solidworks or STEP file as you like.

These designs were all created for some speakers made by Visaton. The Visaton speaker model is part of the file name, for example FR10. I have no affiliation with Visaton, they just happen to make good, economical speakers.

Visaton also makes speaker grills that can be used with their speakers. You might find them more attractive than the 3D printed grills provided here.

For all the enclosures, the design uses M3x4x5 threaded inserts for attaching the lid.
The bosses for mounting the PCBs are expected to be tapped for M3 screws.
